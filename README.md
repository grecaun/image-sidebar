# Image Sidebar Plugin for Wordpress

This is a wordpress plugin that allows the user to specify two images to display on the sidebar for a given page.

## Instalation

For the easiest install, download the zip in this repo and install it via the plugin manager in wordpress.

You can also place the entirety of the image-sidebar folder in the `%YOURWORDPRESSDIRECTORY%/wp-content/plugins/` folder.

## How-To-Use

Install the plugin then drag it into your sidebar via the widgets page.  Input a page slug and hit save.  This slug represents the page on which you want to display images.  If you try to select images before hitting save after putting in a slug, the images will not be saved.  This may be fixed at a later date.  If no image is specified, a blank image is selected.
